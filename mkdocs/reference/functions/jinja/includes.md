# Jinja Includes 
The jinja includes object enables you to inject text from other files into your yaml configuration. This can be especially useful for dashboard item markdown or SQL Models which can be useful to hold in their own files. 

!!! note 

    Jinja includes blocks behavior differs significantly from the includes configuration object. The key difference is that the jinja includes injects text into your yaml file, while the includes configuration block connects yaml files together in the project.
